# Image_Classification
We are having a custom dataset 9 types of machinary tools. We've used the deep learning techniques where the machine learns using the Resnet50 model to classify custom data. It takes the dataset from the user and provides an interface where we can give the image from the test dataset and gives probability of it for being in any class.
